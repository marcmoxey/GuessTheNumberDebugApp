# Guess the Number Game

A simple number-guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. This project helps practice using breakpoints to debug game logic and track program state.

## Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Provides hints like "Too high" or "Too low".
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Uses breakpoints to inspect the random number and user input.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Set breakpoints in the code (e.g., after generating the random number, after user input).
4. Run the program in debug mode (`F5`).
5. Use the **Watch** window to monitor the random number and user guesses.

## Debugging Tips
- Set breakpoints to inspect the random number and user input.
- Use conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios (e.g., when the user guesses correctly).
